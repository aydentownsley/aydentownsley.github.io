                        I am a young Tulsa creative, with a passion for finding innovative ways to use tech! I am attending Holberton to tackle software development head on and learn about new technologies.
                    I am specializing in Augmented and Virtual Reality. I also have a thing for fun aesthetics (hence the retro web1 site)
                    In addition to school I am a hobbyist videographer and have had a blast telling stories through any medium.
                    I try to bring these skills into my work whenever I can. (Just check out the teaser trailer for Rage Chess...).
                    Above all, I love to tell stories, and I will do so in any medium I can get my hands on.
                    I look forward to helping you tell your story, wether it be with tech, words, or images.
                    Feel free to contanct me to dream a little about your latest project!

                    It is an ongoing project that includes an online mulitplayer experience
                    as well as utilizing the chess engine, stockfish, to allow for solo play! I got to work with some phenomenal people
                    on this project and had a blast digging into all things VR. In fact, this very project is what really caused me to fall
                    in love with XR. I started working on this game and quickly bought a Quest 2 so I could spend more time in the space. I am excited to continue
                    to learn and advance my skills. Currently I am working on the solo play aspect of Rage Chess. It has been a very cool experience translating
                    3D data into a parsable string for a uci chess engine like stockfish. <a href="https://github.com/aydentownsley/RageChess/releases/tag/v1.0"><mark>Download it Here!</mark></a>

                    virtual work and layers that digital object with the physical world. Above you can see that layout as it appears in the Unity Project. If you

                    Audio, was the main eye opener. Having good sounds and music are so essential to a fun and immersive game! I put alot of that
